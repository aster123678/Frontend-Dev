            <p>The <mark>earth</mark> is a beautiful place. Nature provides everything we need to survive and thrive.</p>
            <p>Forests are home to countless species. They also act as <mark>lungs</mark> for our planet, absorbing carbon dioxide.</p>
            <p>Rivers and lakes provide <mark>freshwater</mark> for humans and animals alike. Protecting them is crucial.</p>
            <p>Mountains offer not only scenic beauty but also affect weather patterns and <mark>climate</mark> zones.</p>
            <p>The oceans cover most of the planet and hold incredible <mark>biodiversity</mark> that is still largely unexplored.</p>
